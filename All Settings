Here are some useful development tools that can streamline your workflow and boost productivity, especially for a setup involving code editing, debugging, and documentation referencing:

1. Visual Studio Code Extensions
Prettier: For code formatting; keeps code consistent.
ESLint: Lints code to ensure best practices and catches errors early.
Live Server: For real-time reloading while working on web projects.
GitLens: For advanced Git capabilities within VSCode, showing who changed what and why.
Tabnine: AI-powered autocompletions, especially helpful for faster coding.
Debugger for Chrome: Great for debugging JavaScript directly within VSCode.
2. Browser Developer Tools (Chrome/Firefox DevTools)
Network Tab: Debugs loading times, API calls, and network requests.
Elements Tab: Inspects and manipulates HTML and CSS on the fly.
Performance Tab: Analyzes page performance and optimizes rendering speed.
Lighthouse: Evaluates page performance, SEO, and accessibility directly in Chrome DevTools.
3. Postman
Excellent for testing APIs, making requests, and setting up automated tests.
It supports various HTTP requests and can handle complex workflows.
4. Docker
Enables isolated development environments, making it easy to run and manage apps locally.
A great choice for maintaining consistency across different development and production environments.
5. Figma (or Excalidraw for simpler visuals)
For visual design and prototyping. Essential if your work involves UI/UX considerations.
Excalidraw provides quick, hand-drawn style sketches for visual planning.
6. Notion or Obsidian for Documentation
Keep notes organized and accessible. You can create project-specific or code-specific references for quick access while developing.
Both allow easy linking between notes and support various content formats.
7. JIRA/Trello for Task Management
Helps keep track of tasks, bugs, and feature requests. JIRA is more detailed for Agile processes, while Trello is simpler and visually appealing.
8. GitHub Desktop or GitKraken
For an intuitive graphical interface for Git, making it easier to manage branches, commits, and merges.
9. Microsoft PowerToys
For Windows users, PowerToys includes tools like FancyZones, which helps arrange your workspace efficiently, perfect for a dual- or multi-window setup.
10. Alfred (Mac) or Wox (Windows)
A quick launcher tool that speeds up access to apps, files, and workflows, helping you stay focused and reduce mouse use.
With this setup, you should have a comprehensive toolkit for various development needs, all while keeping productivity and efficiency in mind.
